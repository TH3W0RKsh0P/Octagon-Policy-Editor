# Octagon Policy Editor

Welcome to Octagon Policy Editor!
Octagon Policy Editor is a recreation of Pollen, Pentagon, and Polygon. This allows you to force install extensions to your liking, and if you are doing this to modify account policies, like on a school account, you can keep gogaurdian. 


**Using Octagon for temporary purposes:**

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login as root

Step 4: Execute the Octagon Policy Editor Command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NonagonWorkshop/Octagon-Policy-Editor/main/Octagon.sh | bash
```

NOTE: This is only temporary and the Policy Editor will go away on your next Restart / Reboot (sudo reboot)! 
If you want to make it permanent please proceed the the next set of instructions.

This is to my friend who took everything from Octagon, and so called "Updated" it, to have no "AI Slop". If you seriously think grammar and using a bunch of echos means you used AI, then you should really consider taking some coding classes. For anyone wanting to check out the "No AI Slop" version, go ahead and look at the commits: All that was really "Updated" were the echos and what he thinks is "grammar". (All he really did was change "based off of" to "based on"..
