# Polygon-Policy-Editor

Welcome to Polygon Policy Editor!
Polygon Policy Editor is my own recreation of Pollen Policy Editor & Pentagon Policy Editor, except unlike Pollen, Polygon won't remove extensions such as GoGuardian, but rather add them as force-installed extensions. You can always add your own force installed extensions to the script if you need to, or remove them!


**Executing Polygon for temporary use:**

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login as root

Step 4: Execute the Polygon Policy Editor Command:

```
curl -Ls
