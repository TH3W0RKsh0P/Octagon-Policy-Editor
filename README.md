# Polygon Policy Editor

Welcome to Polygon Policy Editor!
Polygon Policy Editor is my own recreation of Pollen Policy Editor & Pentagon Policy Editor, except unlike Pollen, Polygon won't remove extensions such as GoGuardian, but rather add them as force-installed extensions. You can always add your own force installed extensions to the script if you need to, or remove them!


**Executing Polygon for temporary use:**

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login as root

Step 4: Execute the Polygon Policy Editor Command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NonagonWorkshop/Polygon-Policy-Editor/refs/heads/main/polygon_policy.sh | bash
```

NOTE: This is only temporary and the Policy Editor will go away on your next Restart / Reboot (sudo reboot)! 
If you want to make it permanent please proceed the the next set of instructions.

Executing Polygon for permanent use:

Step 1: Make sure you are in Developer Mode

Step 2: Enter the VT2 Shell (Control + ALT + F2)

Step 3: Login is as root

Step 4: Execute the Polygon RootFS Command:

```
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NonagonWorkshop/Polygon-Policy-Editor/refs/heads/main/polygon_rootfs.sh | bash
```

Once the PolygonRootFS script is executed successfully, reboot your computer (sudo reboot), then head back to the VT2 Shell and execute the Polygon Policy Editor Command.

If you already have RootFS Disabled, then you are not required to run the Polygon RootFS Disabler.

HEADS UP, PLEASE READ! A Policy Editor cannot re-enroll your device, re-enrollment happens through firmware based crap, bascily at a TMP Level, the only way that would happen is from running a completely different command mean't to enroll your device, or by doing it manually by clicking the obvious "enroll device" button when you first sign into your chromebook. Most Policy Editors can't even modify device level policies, and it is VERY VERY unlikely a Policy Editor would trigger an enrollment process. All a Policy Editor does is edit the Policy.json file / delete it and create a modified version. This for anyone that thinks a Policy Editor can enroll your device..
